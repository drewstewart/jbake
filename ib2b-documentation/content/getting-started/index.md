# The Basics

These iB2B documents are generated by the `nbn-jbake` static page generation tool - it is a command line tool used to both generate the documentation and to serve the content to your browser. 

All the documents are written using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) which is intended to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write. Here's an example snippet of markdown:

```
# I'm a heading

## And I'm a sub-heading

Separate your paragraphs with newlines. Create a list:

- Item
- Another item
```




## iB2B Project Structure

Projects have the following structure

```
.
| README.md
|-- assets
|   |-- css
|   |-- fonts
|   |-- img
|   |-- js
|-- content
|   |-- about
|       |-- index.md
|   |-- services
|       |-- manage_product_order.md
|-- templates
|   |-- index.liquid
|   |-- interface-specification.liquid
|   |-- partials
|       |-- header.liquid
|-- jbake.properties
```

### Assets

Holds the static files that are copied to the root of the destination folder. Any folder structure created will be maintained. Note that this folder holds all the css and js required to style the documents. Other assets you might place here include images and sample messages.

### Content

Place the dynamic site content in this folder. The content contained within the files in this folder will be "mixed" with the templates to generate the documentation. It is important to note that files must end with a `.md` extension to be included in the rendering cycle.

### Templates

Liquid templates describe how to render the documentation. Liquid templates originated from Shopify, they offer a safe templating language for flexible web apps and tools. See [the wiki](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) for details on how to use.

Note that templates only need to be changed when updating the documentation output style. This shouldn't occur very often.

## Create a new spec

Create a file with `.md` extension in the `content` folder. You can create any subfolder structure and this will be maintained when the documentation is generated and will determine the URL the document is available at. For example, if you create a subfolder `products` and place `index.md` the generated document will be available at http://localhost:8820/products/

### Metadata header

Each markdown must have a metadata header before any content. The header is used to determine what template to render the content with, whether it is published, document title etc. A metadata header is a list of key value pairs 

### Subfolders

### Linking to assets

### Including partials

# Customising the markdown html output

In the `org.jbake.parser` package there is the `MarkdownEngine` class. It contains an inner class `MyHtmlSerializer` - this is where you override the `public void visit(NodeType node)` method to customise how each node is rendered to html. For example:

```
// Override how Tables are rendered
@Override
public void visit(TableNode node) {
    this.currentTableNode = node;
    this.printIndentedTag(node, "table class="table table-bordered table-striped\"");
    this.currentTableNode = null;
}
```

`MyHtmlSerializer` extends `ToHtmlSerializer`, see the decompiled class for examples on how other tags are handled and override as needed.
